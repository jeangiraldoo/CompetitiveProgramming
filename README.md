# Competitive programming

This repository contains my solutions and notes from various programming competitions Iâ€™ve participated in.
I explore different programming languages and technologies here, as I like to experiment with new tools and approaches during hackathons and contests.

Feel free to check out the code and docs, you might find something useful or interesting!
